## Why is this project important?
New ideas are conceived everyday. In recent years, crowdfunding has become a go-to outlet for making these ideas a reality. However, a large portion of these crowdfunding campaigns fail while others manage to generate over ten times the amount of funding sought. This project aims to see what makes some projects succeed and raise so much additional funding while other projects fail.

This project can prove to be useful and would be able to provide vital information to many different communities within the business, technology, and entrepreneurship industries. One obvious group that would be able to benefit from this project would be start-up companies, entrepreneurs, or people who just have new ideas to market. This project would be able to help these groups identify if their ideas and inventions will lead to success, approximate how much funding they could raise, and understand how to improve their designs to make their product more successful. This project can also be very benefitting for Venture Capitalist organizations and individuals, as it may be able to help them identify quickly which new ideas and products on the market would be successful and allow them to invest wisely.
